# TODO: Crypto Wallet CLI Shell

- [ ] Review all shell scripts in the project
    - [ ] Confirm any random number usage: ensure it's NOT used directly as a private key, only as a seed (or securely documented)
    - [ ] Refactor/rename shell scripts for clarity and consistency
    - [ ] Update and revise related man page(s) documentation for new script names/features

- [ ] Add wallet features & CLI tools:
    - [ ] Public key generator command/script
    - [ ] Wallet balance checker
    - [ ] Wallet send functionality (transaction script/command)
    - [ ] Implement option to select testnet or mainnet (e.g. `--testnet`, `--mainnet`)
